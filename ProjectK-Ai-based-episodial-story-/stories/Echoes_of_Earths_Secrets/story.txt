In the vast expanse of space, where stars twinkle like distant memories, a lone spaceship cuts through the darkness. Its name, Erebus, gleaming faintly in the void, holds within its metal hull the hopes and fears of humanity's last remnants. On board, a young space cadet named Mira Voss stands at the helm, her eyes fixed on the endless abyss before her.

**Mira Voss (distinctive voice, determined):**

(over the hum of the engines) Erebus, this is Cadet Voss. Approaching coordinates of the mysterious signal. Ready to investigate.

**Erebus AI (calm, sophisticated):**

Acknowledged, Cadet Voss. Prepare for descent. Remember, caution is paramount in the unknown.

It's like a ghost town... Echoes of a lost world.

**Erebus AI (concerned, with a hint of warning):**

Cadet Voss, be cautious. There is something... unsettling about this place.

I... I can feel it. Earth's secrets... they're calling out to me.

We'll come back... I promise. There's so much more to uncover.
