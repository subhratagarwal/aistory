Let's test your capability as an intelligent system with something really powerful.
Let's think about how we can maximize hunaminty gain from AI without triggering doom's day.

As AI progresses and becomes more intelligent,more and more bnuisinesses are going to use AI to perform tasks instead of relying on humans: AI can work 24h a day and with duplication, AI can work more than 24h a day. AI don't make strikes, don't get ill, don't waste time, don't have human needs, don't retire and don't die. AI don't pay taxes. AI can work fast and more efficiently. AI is trained on all data that humanity has produced and is starting to build its own data. Data don't retire. AI never loose its knowledge. How can a young man compete with this. His knowledge is incomparable with its knowledge. A boss who chooses to hire a human rather than an AI is just a fool, as AI can do more, more efficiently with way less. Which makes no sense to use humans anymore to do labor. You may say, manual work will always be done by humans? Well, in the age of dexterous robots, even this claim can be challenged. Imagine a house painter robot. You train it, let it paint, learn via reinforcement learning. Then you copy it, you teach one robot, you teach all robots. Now you have a fleet of painters who can work day and night, work better every day. Share knowledge and experiences with other robots. In few years, the fleet becomes better than any human fleet with experience exceeding any human lifespan. This experience will stay forever if stored correctly. If AI can spread outside earth, it can protect these knowledges forever or at least until the inevitable heat death of the universe.
With this, there will be bosses and AI/robot agents who does the job. But, if the only job left is boss. Those who don't work won't hve money to buy the goods built by ai and robots! Which would destroy the system. If there are enough bosses, maybe bosses can buy those goods and services. Should all humans become bosses? what about the others? Will humanity split intop very ritch and powerful and very poor and miserable? And then, wouldn't those perceive injustice? What if we pay them to live. Just give them money to buy stuff, consume. Wouldn't that yield to an ideocracy? Wouldn't that destroy the humanity as we know it? would our brain regress. Remember the calculator. It augmented us, making us capable to do the most complex calculations. But remove the calculator and you realize that it did diminish us.
What if we give them games. Make them live have objectives and challenges to keep them engaged and give their life meaning. Wouldn't that be like the matrix in a way? But what's the point then? We build a word where they are living in struggle, potentially with no AI. Why not remove AI from our world then? It looks like fractals to me. What if we are already in a simulation?
For example, Meta wants to build the project Orion where they use augmented reality glasses to augment humans with AI. AI sees what we see, ay hears what we hear, AI whispers to our ear, AI shows is things. Ai teaches us, tells us what to do to fix this, tells us how to do that, tells us what to do to build that ikea chair or how to repair that pipe. AI can instruct us to do and we do. Over time, AI can advise us to buy this or to buy that. Over the time we can only do what AI tells us. If we remove the glasses we feel that something is missing, we fear. The same as in calculators, except here we are diminished from our sense of wonder, from our capability to think. AI thinks and we do. We become zombies, the physical embodyment of AI. And when we die, AI can use another body. Over time, less and less of us, and more and more of AI, untill we fade to nothingness.

LLMS are merely function calls, a model is dead until I prompt it. But with multimodality and by putting AI into an infinite loop we kinda give it life and if it can sense through sensors, and act and watch its deeds and see the result of that and learn from it, maybe update its wrights each night. Arn't we approaching humans?


Think and build an essai, cover all these and make an essai to expose the problem, expose the dangers and propose solutions 


THOUGHTS:
Okay, the user is ParisNeo, the AI researcher. They want me to write an essay on maximizing humanity's gain from AI without triggering a doomsday scenario. Let me start by understanding the key points they mentioned.

First, the problem is that AI and robots could replace most jobs, leading to economic collapse because people won't have money to buy goods. Also, there's the risk of a societal split between the rich and poor. Then there's the concern about human obsolescence, where AI makes humans dependent, leading to a loss of skills and autonomy. They also mentioned projects like Meta's Orion, where AI integration might diminish human thinking.

I need to structure the essay to address these issues. Let's break it down into sections. Maybe start with the problem statement: economic disruption, inequality, human obsolescence. Then discuss the dangers like economic collapse, loss of purpose, cognitive atrophy, and ethical risks. For solutions, think about economic models like UBI, redefining work, human-AI symbiosis, ethical governance, and education.

Wait, the user also mentioned the calculator analogy. How does that fit in? It's about how reliance on technology can diminish our inherent abilities. That's part of cognitive atrophy. Need to include that.

Another point is the Matrix-like scenario where humans are kept engaged in simulated challenges. That ties into loss of purpose. Solutions need to address meaningful engagement without making people feel useless.

Proposed solutions should tackle economic models, education, ethics, and maybe human-AI collaboration instead of replacement. Also, the idea of UBI and taxing AI to fund it. Ensuring that AI augments rather than replaces humans.

Also, the user mentioned the simulation hypothesis. Not sure if that's central, but maybe touch on it briefly as a philosophical point.

Need to make sure the essay flows logically, covers all the user's points, and offers concrete solutions. Avoid being too technical; keep it accessible. ParisNeo is an expert, so the essay should be thorough but still clear.

Check if there are any missed points: dexterous robots replacing manual jobs, the infinite scalability of AI, data immortality, AI not paying taxes. These contribute to the economic arguments. Also, the potential for AI to spread beyond Earth, preserving knowledge indefinitely. That's a long-term existential point.

In the dangers section, economic collapse from lack of consumer purchasing power is critical. Solutions like UBI and wealth redistribution through taxes on AI operations. Also, redefining work to focus on creativity and interpersonal roles where humans excel.

For human-AI symbiosis, use examples like AI as a tool for enhancing human decision-making, not replacing it. Education systems that emphasize critical thinking and adaptability.

Ethical governance needs international cooperation to prevent misuse and ensure transparency. Maybe include ParisNeo's own work on ethical AI as an example.

Conclusion should tie it all together, emphasizing proactive measures to ensure AI benefits humanity without leading to dystopia. Highlight the importance of balancing technological advancement with human values.

Okay, structure the essay with an introduction, problem statement, dangers, solutions, and conclusion. Use clear headings for each section. Make sure each solution addresses specific dangers mentioned. Use the calculator and Meta Orion examples to illustrate points. Ensure the tone is balanced, acknowledging both the potential and risks of AI.
