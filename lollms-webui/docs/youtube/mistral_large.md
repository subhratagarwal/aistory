Hi there. Today, we're diving into the exciting world of Mistral AI as we put their new large model to the test. We'll be revisiting our beloved snake game, previously built using GPT-3, and see if we can kick it up a notch with Mistral's innovative technology. Let's get started!

First, we'll need to select Mistral AI in our lollms system. Now, it's important to note that this model isn't available as an open-source option just yet, and it's likely too large to run on your local device. So, we'll be using MistralAI's API to access their powerful hosted model.

Now, let's give it a try and see if the Mistral large model can rise to the challenge. We're going to test its capabilities by asking it to build a functioning snake game in just one prompt. And to make things more specific, we'll instruct it to use Pygame as our game engine. Let's see what it can do!

It is generating the game in a lollms code tag as requested and we can see that it is using pygame. The code looks correct at first glance. Once the code is finished we'll execute it directly from lollms.

For those of you following along at home, I've already installed Pygame on lollms, so we won't need to execute the Pygame installation script suggested by the Mistral model. However, if you haven't installed it yet, don't worry! Simply run the suggested script, and you'll be ready to go. Let's continue with our snake game and see what Mistral AI can do.

VoilÃ ! Our game is up and running, and it's working correctly. It's quite fast but working as expected. This means we have a solid foundation to build upon. We're not stopping here, though. Next, we'll explore how we can push the boundaries even further to create an even better game.

I'll be the first to admit that I'm not the best player out there, but that's part of the fun, right? Let's see how I do. Spoiler alert: I might just be the worst snake game player you've ever seen. Hahaha!


Well, folks, it looks like my lack of gaming skills has struck again! I've lost the game, but hey, it's all part of the testing process.

Let's take this game up a notch, shall we? I think it's time to challenge our Mistral model to make some improvements. First, let's ask it to slow down the game a bit, making it more beginner-friendly. Then, we'll request some extra lives to keep the fun going for longer. And you know what would be the cherry on top? A score viewer to keep track of our progress. Let's see if Mistral can deliver!

You might have noticed that every time I hit 'Execute', a message box appears asking for confirmation. This is a new safety feature we've introduced in lollms to prevent potential attackers from injecting malicious code into our system. We believe in putting safety first! If you ever see this message pop up without having initiated execution, it's best to decline and check your security settings. I want to give a shoutout to huntr.dev platform for their invaluable support in helping us make open source projects safer. While you can deactivate this option, we strongly advise against it, especially if you're exposing your lollms server outside your network. Remember, you're responsible for your actions. Now, let's dive back into our game and explore what other improvements we can make.

And there you have it! Our game now proudly displays the score and the number of lives left. It's clear that the Mistral large model is more than capable of handling this task. Plus, the game speed has been toned down a notch, making it much more playable for beginners like myself. Who knows, with these improvements, I might actually stand a chance at becoming a decent snake game player!

Now, I want you all to know, what you're about to witness is completely intentional and in no way a reflection of my gaming skills... or lack thereof. I'm doing this for science, people! Let's see those extra lives in action!

And there we have it, folks! I've managed to lose not one, not two, but all three lives. I guess you could say I'm really giving this game a thorough test, right? ðŸ˜‚ But jokes aside, the game is performing fantastically so far - I'd give it a solid 10 out of 10. 

let's kick things up a notch and see if our AI can handle a curveball. Some of you might be thinking that this AI is just mimicking a game it's seen before, and that's why it's doing so well. But don't be too sure just yet! Let's put it to the test by asking it to do something a bit more...unusual. How about we make the apple color change randomly, and have the snake reflect that color as well? Now, that's a challenge! Let's see if our AI can rise to the occasion.

Well, let's take a moment to appreciate this AI's unique approach. It's not just diving headfirst into coding, but taking a step back to rephrase our request. This shows that it's really processing our instructions and making sure it understands exactly what we're asking for. Now, let's see how it tackles this new challenge!

The first apple is white, and so is the snake. Let's see what happens when I chow down on this apple. Oh, would you look at that? The next apple is blue, and our snake has transformed into a blue beauty! I'll give it a thumbs up, but I can't help but think it would make more sense if the snake took on the color of the apple it just ate, not the next one. Am I right, or am I right?

Wow, what a time to be alive, huh? If you had shown me this before 2020, I would have thought it was some sort of sorcery or a scene straight out of a sci-fi movie! But look how far we've come in just a few short years. The pace of technological advancements is skyrocketing, and it's only getting faster. Makes you wonder what the future holds for AI and humanity. But hey, let's not get too existential here. Back to our color-changing snake game!


Now, let's try rephrasing our prompt. Remember, folks, it's crucial to communicate clearly with AI, because unfortunately, it hasn't mastered mind-reading yet. If your instructions can be interpreted in multiple ways, it's a roll of the dice whether AI will understand what you want or not. So, be clear and concise, and most importantly, make sure you don't accidentally ask it to destroy the world. We wouldn't want to end humanity just because of a little wording mistake, now would we? Safety first, people!

Whoa! Even though I'm speeding up my voice here, the generation speed is in real-time. This AI is churning out code faster than I can keep up with my own thoughts! It's like having a supercharged coding sidekick. Mind-blowing, isn't it?


Uh-oh, it looks like we've hit a snag! The code isn't executing and I'm feeling a little panic bubbling up. But hey, no need to press the panic button just yet. Let's take a deep breath, put on our detective hats, and figure out what's going on. After all, every problem is just an opportunity for a new solution, right?

Ah, I see what's happening here! Our AI has become a bit of a code hoarder, and our context size is feeling a bit claustrophobic. Now, I'm keeping the context size on a tight leash at just 4096 tokens to avoid breaking the bank, since our friendly AI's services aren't exactly free. But fear not! I won't be pushing our limits to the max of 32,000 tokens, oh no. Instead, I'll just bump up the minimum number of tokens to generate from 1024 to 2048. It's like giving our AI a little more legroom without upgrading to first class. And thanks to lollms' sliding window, I think 2048 tokens of previous discussion context will be plenty for our AI to keep up. Phew, crisis averted and my wallet is still happy!

Ok, the AI seems to go further in the generation process.

Alright, folks! Our AI has worked its magic and it looks like we've got ourselves a complete code. It's time to put it to the test and see if it can dazzle us once again. Fingers crossed, and let's dive in!

Well, well, well, aren't we getting creative! The snake is now taking on some characteristics of the next apple, but it seems to have a bit of a memory, holding onto some of the previous apple's color. We're not quite in the promised land yet, but hey, progress is progress, right? Let's keep pushing forward and see how we can fine-tune this colorful conundrum!

Alright, I'm starting to feel like a pro gamer here! As I maneuver this colorful snake, let's take a moment to ponder something a bit more serious: AI ethics. You know, just your typical gaming session and deep philosophical discussion.

As we navigate this digital world, it's crucial to consider the ethical implications of AI. For instance, how do we ensure fairness and avoid biases in AI systems? How do we balance privacy concerns with the benefits AI can bring? And most importantly, how do we create AI that complements and enhances human capabilities without replacing them? But hey, let's not get too serious here. I mean, we're just trying to make a snake game, not solve world hunger. But who knows, maybe our colorful snake will inspire the next big AI breakthrough. Stranger things have happened, right?

Alright, it's time to tackle the not-so-giant, but certainly noticeable elephant in the room - that pesky misaligned game over text! I mean, it's been driving me up the wall since we started, and our game deserves better. So let's enlist the help of our AI companion to center that text and give our game over screen the polished look it so rightly deserves. And, since we're on a roll, let's give that colorful snake idea another shot. This time, we'll ask our AI friend to make the snake reflect all the beautiful hues of the apples it has consumed. Fingers crossed, it'll rise to the challenge and our game will be looking snazzier than ever!

Alright folks, to save us some time, I'm going to fast-forward through this part. We don't want to keep you waiting while our AI works its magic. Let's skip ahead and see the exciting results of our request!

It seems like our AI friend might need a little more guidance to get things just right. It's crucial to be specific and clear when making requests, so it knows exactly what we're looking for. Let's not be disheartened, though! We'll give it another shot, and this time, we'll make sure to provide more details to help our AI companion better understand our vision for the game. After all, practice makes perfect, and we're all learning together on this AI-powered journey!

Finally, the game over text has been tamed and put in its rightful place - the center! It's the small victories that count, folks. We're one step closer to having the perfect snake game. High five to our AI friend for a job well done on the text front. Now, let's see if we can get that colorful snake situation under control too!

Fingers crossed, the snake's head is white â€“ a good sign! Let's see if we finally nailed the colorful snake challenge!

Hurray, yes, it finally neiled it. The snake is getting multicolored as I asked and it is inheriting the colors of the apples it is eating!

Wohoo, we've done it! The AI has finally cracked the code. Our snake is now a marvelous, multicolored creature, inheriting the hues of the apples it devours. It's like a rolling rainbow on our screen. I could almost call it... delicious!

As I navigate the vibrant maze with my newly colored snake, let's chat about the fascinating world of AI. Artificial Intelligence has come a long way, transforming the way we live, work, and play.
