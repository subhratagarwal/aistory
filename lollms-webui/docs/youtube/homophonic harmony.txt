(catchy guitar riff melodic intro)
(Verse 1)
I see you there, standing over there
Their clothes are new, they're looking cool
To go too far, or two steps more?
For four's the score, we're keeping score

(Chorus)
Oh, it's a homophonic world
Where words collide and meanings swirl
Hear the sound, but don't be fooled
Here's the game that can't be ruled

(Verse 2)
The bear is bare, but please don't stare
We'll pair the pear with utmost care
The knight at night will write it right
The site's in sight, it's quite a sight

(Bridge)
Reign or rain, it's all the same
Rein it in, don't miss the main
Mane of glory, what a story
Homophones in all their glory

(Chorus)
Oh, it's a homophonic world
Where words collide and meanings swirl
Hear the sound, but don't be fooled
Here's the game that can't be ruled

(Outro)
So whether or not the weather's hot
We've tied a knot of wordy thoughts
This tale we've told, both new and old
Has homophonic gold, all told!
