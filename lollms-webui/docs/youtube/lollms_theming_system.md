Hi there!

Today I'm gonna show you the new lollms theming system.

The first notisable change is in the top bar. In an effort to make the ui more slick, I made it retractable to leave more space for your chats. You can pin it if you prefer to make it visible all the time.

Since last update, you can choose from multiple themes. Each theme has both a light and dark mode.

themes change the look and feel of the UI, but also change the welcome message, the loading page, the drop menues etc.

For now, you can choose from a set of themes I have built myself, but let me know in the comments, if you would like me to create an app that builds themes for lollms and adds them to the list so that you can make custom personal themes for yourself.

From now on, the welcome page will contain news about the features and updates I add to lollms. You should find interesting information in there, so make sure to read those news as they drop.


If you notice a play button at the bottom right of your screen, it indicates that a new video has been released on my YouTube channel. By clicking this button, you'll be seamlessly redirected to watch the video. Once you've clicked it, the button will disappear until a new video is uploaded.

Rest assured, lollms respects your privacy and does not track users. Watching my videos is entirely voluntary, but it provides valuable insights into how many people are engaging with the platform, helping me assess its impact and value. I encourage you to leave comments on the videos to share your thoughts, suggest enhancements, or ask questions. Your feedback is invaluable to me.

Additionally, liking and sharing my videos can significantly boost visibility. If you enjoy the content and want to stay updated, consider subscribing to my channelâ€”it's completely free!

I'm thrilled to share that the lollms platform now hosts more than 500 personalities in the zoo and over 100 apps, offering a diverse range of experiences and functionalities for you to explore.

Thank you for being a part of the community, and I hope you enjoy the content I create for you.

See ya
