Hi there! Today, I'm thrilled to share some exciting news about a major update to our open router binding. If you're interested in AI, robotics, or just love exploring new technologies, then you're in the right place!
As many of you may know, working with AI models can sometimes be challenging, especially if you don't have access to high-end GPUs or the budget for paid AI services. We believe that everyone should have the opportunity to experiment and benefit from AI, regardless of their resources, which led us to develop lollms and our open router.
In a recent update, we've introduced an upgraded open router binding that significantly expands the model zoo, now offering a total of 117 models! This upgrade includes popular options like Claude, GPT4, DBRX, and Command-R, along with many new and exciting models to try.

To make AI even more accessible, we've included eight free models in the update, which can be easily found by typing "free" into the models zoo search box. These free models serve as an excellent starting point for those new to AI, while the paid models cater to users seeking more advanced capabilities.
The lollms open router's primary strength lies in its versatility and accessibility. Our system supports a wide range of models and offers free options, breaking down barriers for users with varying needs and resources.

Here's a quick overview of the key benefits:

Expanded Model Zoo: With 117 models available, you'll have no shortage of options to explore and utilize.
Accessible AI: The eight free models allow users with limited resources to work with AI, fostering innovation and learning.
Easy Discovery: Typing "free" into the search box helps you quickly find the free models, saving you time and effort.
Versatility: The lollms open router supports a wide variety of models, enabling you to find the perfect fit for your needs.
I hope you're as excited about this update as I am! By continuously expanding the model zoo and offering free options, we're committed to making AI more approachable for everyone.
