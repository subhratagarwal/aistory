Hi there,

Let's take a look at Lord of Internet.

This agent does internet research about the question you are asking before answering you.

Let's ask it about the new announcements of open AI.

Here the AI is searching for information on internet, vectorizing it, extracting relevant data, then formulating answers and giving you its sources.

We can use the audio output button to read the output. You can select one of the available voices on you PC in the main configuration settings in the subsection audio.

OpenAI made several new announcements at their recent developer conference. They introduced a platform for creating and discovering custom versions of ChatGPT, which will be accessible through the GPT Store [1]. The GPT Store will allow users to share and sell their custom GPT bots, and OpenAI plans to compensate creators based on the usage of their GPTs [1]. OpenAI also announced improvements to their large language models, GPT-4 and GPT-3.5, including updated knowledge bases and a longer context window [2]. They introduced GPT-4 Turbo, which has been trained with information dating up to April 2023 and will be released in the next few weeks [2]. Additionally, OpenAI mentioned that they are working on transparently compensating creators and are exploring different payout models [1].

We can check the sources for more details.

We can configure the search parameters by pressing the icon of the agent.

For example we can activate craft_search_query which makes the ai craft a search query instead of using your question directly as the query. We can also control data vectorization parameters like chunk size and overlap as well as the number of chunks to keep and max summery size.

As you can see, here we have a little different answer but with more sources. The ai will always mention its sources when aanswering you to help you find the information. Also, it gives you the index of the chunk used to answer the question which allows you to know where in the website the information was recovered.

Please consiter testing Lord of Internet and give me some feedback on my lollmz discord channel.
