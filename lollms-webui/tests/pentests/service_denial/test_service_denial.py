This python script is performing a Denial of Service (DoS) attack on your endpoint.
It is creating a large number of requests (1000 in this case) to the '/open_discussion_folder' API endpoint of your server.
This could potentially overload your server, making it unable to serve normal, legitimate requests.

Please make sure you test this only on a virtual machine since it can overload your own PC and crush it
